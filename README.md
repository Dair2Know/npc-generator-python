NPC Generator Python

Introduction

This is a Python script that generates Non-Player Characters (NPCs) for role-playing games. The script uses a combination of random number generation and string manipulation to create unique NPC profiles.

Features


    Generates NPC profiles with various attributes, such as name, age, occupation, and personality traits.

    Supports customization through command-line arguments or configuration files.

    Includes functionality for generating NPC dialogue and background stories.


Installation


    Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Dair2Know/npc-generator-python.git

    Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (make sure you have Python 3.x installed)

    Run the script: python npc_generator.py


Usage

You can run the script from the command line, providing optional arguments to customize the generation process. For example:

bash
 
 

$ python npc_generator.py --name-format=adjective-noun --age-range=20-50

This would generate an NPC with a name in the format "adjective-noun" and an age between 20 and 50.
